# dst_assessment1
This project builds supervised machine-learning models to predict outcomes of men’s ODI cricket matches using data from the cricketdata package (ESPN & Cricsheet sources). Each team member develops an independent classification or regression model — for example, predicting whether a team wins, or estimating the final score margin — and evaluates it on a shared validation and test split.

The repository contains:
• Data preprocessing scripts extending the cleaned 2015-onwards ODI dataset from Assessment 0.
• Model training notebooks (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, etc.).
• Shared evaluation framework with agreed performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, ROC-AUC, log-loss).
• Comparative analysis and group discussion on model robustness and metric appropriateness.
