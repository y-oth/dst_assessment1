# dst_assessment1
This project builds supervised machine-learning models to predict outcomes of men’s ODI cricket matches using data from the cricketdata package (ESPN & Cricsheet sources). Each team member develops an independent classification  model predicting which team won a cricket match based on the first innnings and the first 10 overs.

The repository contains:
* Data preprocessing scripts extending the cleaned 2015-onwards ODI dataset from Assessment 0.
* Model training notebooks ( logistic regression, random forest, logistic mixed effects model).
* Shared evaluation framework with agreed performance metrics (ROC-AUC).
* Comparative analysis and group discussion on model robustness and metric appropriateness.
